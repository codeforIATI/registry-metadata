# Registry Metadata

All the registry metadata, in two files:

 * [publisher_list.json](https://registry.codeforiati.org/publisher_list.json) contains a list of publisher metadata from the registry
 * [dataset_list.json](https://registry.codeforiati.org/dataset_list.json) contains a list of dataset metadata from the registry

Both files are updated every 3-4 hours.

---

**_\*BONUS!\*_** A CSV of [mappings of past to current publisher IDs](https://registry.codeforiati.org/registry_id_relationships.csv)
